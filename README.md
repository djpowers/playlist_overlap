# Playlist Overlap

This project generates a simple visualization of the common songs and artists between one or more Spotify playlists.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have a [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) account, and create a new application. Duplicate the `.env.example` file to `.env`, adding in your own credentials.

With Ruby installed, run `bundle` to install dependencies. Run the local Sinatra server using `ruby myapp.rb`, and visit the page at `http://localhost:4567` using the default port settings.
